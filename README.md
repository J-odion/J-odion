Hi, I'm [Emmanuel Jafaru], an enthusiatic  self-taught Unity Game Developer and full stack web developer. My passion for Game development goes way back into my primary school days where I would pull in Zuma delux game into notepad and edit the colors to make the levels easier to play (smiling face emoji, winks). Those days ended qucikly and a whloe lot transpired. but here we are in the hands of Unity after going through React, Laravel, Vue, Angular, and a host of others framework. oh did i forget flutter?.



I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
